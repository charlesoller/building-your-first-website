            <p class="index__section-text"> In the past, necessity was the basis for woodfiring, whereas today another
                 necessity—that of personal choices related to aesthetic decision-making—usually
                 prevails. I credit four primary sources for the current interest in woodfiring.
                 They are: the medieval Japanese ceramics produced during the rise of the so-called
                 "Six Great Kilns," (a term no longer considered accurate by art historians in light
                 of recent excavations); the French work centered around La Borne; the woodfired
                 salt-glazed wares, especially those of North Carolina; and the alkaline-glazed
                 tradition from the Edgewater, South Carolina, area. My choices are based on
                 information from peer professionals who practice woodfiring consistently and who
                 responded to queries about historical influences. - Jack Troy</p>

            <p class="index__section-text">
                Some say our aesthetic relies on chance, but that’s not completely true. While
                chance certainly plays a role in determining the surface quality of our work, it’s much
                more that. Our pots are dusted by chance and painted by atmospheric turbulence. - Mark Hewitt

                There is no simple way to help you envision wood firing, the complex process has
                dominated my life for 30 years.  The kilns are custom-built, they are big enough to
                walk or crawl in. The fire temperatures are hot enough to melt wood ash, turning it
                into glass.  The firings take days of round-the-clock tending to achieve and hold
                temperature.  The pots I make are selected for their reactivity to flame and ash,
                each has its own color palette to be evoked.  And after the firing we hand sand each
                piece so the surfaces are both visually and tactilly lush. - Simon Levin
